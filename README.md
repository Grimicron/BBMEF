Breaking Bad: Meth Empire (Forge) is a mod which adds many items to roleplay as BrBa characters in Minecraft. It was originally going to be made in Fabric but that
idea was scrapped after realizing there wasn't enough support for Fabric. It is completely open-source, so anyone can expand upon it without worries (this software
is licensed with the Apache 2.0 license, an Open Source Initiative approved license). I made this mod because I saw that there were not any BrBa mods for newer
versions of Minecraft, so I decided to do it myself. Thanks for checking out this project!
